## Release Philosophy

`go-ipfs` aims to have release every six weeks, two releases per quarter. During these 6 week releases, we go through 4 different stages of Release Candidates (RC) that gives us the opportunity to test the new version against our test environments (unit, interop, integration), QA in our current production environmment, IPFS apps (e.g. Desktop and WebUI) and with our _early testers_<sup>[1]</sup> that have IPFS running in Production, by leveraging their own test infrastructure and QA systems.

We might expand the six week release schedule in case of:
- No new updates to be added
- In case of a large community event that takes the core team availability away (e.g. IPFS Conf, Dev Meetings, IPFS Camp, etc)

## Release Flow

`go-ipfs` releases come in 4 stages:

- **Release Stage 1 - Internal testing** - Test the Release against our testing infrastructure, including interoperability, integration, test lab, multiple runtimes and the apps we've built (WebUI, Desktop, NPM on IPFS, HTTP Client Libraries). The intent is to make this stage fully automated (and somewhat is already), until then, we manually check a list and ensure that all tests have been run
- **Release Stage 2 - Invite _early testers_ to try it out** - Reach out to our _early testers_ (i.e. projects that have volunteered to support `go-ipfs` by using their own test infrastructure and tell us the results)
- **Release Stage 3 - Announce to the broader community** - Communicate to the community that a new Release Candidate is ready and that everyone is welcome to test it with us
- **Release Stage 4 - Complete the Release** - Finalize the release, start the next release.

The Release Stages are not linked to Release Candidate numbers, in fact, there can be multiple release candidate per stages as we catch bugs and improve the release itself.

## Performing a Release

The first step is for the `Lead Maintainer` for `go-ipfs` to open an issue with Title `go-ipfs <version> Release` and a c&p of the following template:

```
> <short tl;dr; of the release>

# üó∫ What's left for release

<List of items with PRs and/or Issues to be considered for this release>

# üî¶ Highlights

<List of items with PRs and/or Issues included for this release>

# üèó API Changes

<List of API changes, if any>

# ‚ÅâÔ∏è Do you have questions?

The best place to ask your questions about IPFS, how it works and what you can do with it is at [discuss.ipfs.io](http://discuss.ipfs.io). We are also available at the `#ipfs` channel on Freenode, which is also [accessible through our Matrix bridge](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#freenode_#ipfs:matrix.org).
```

## Release Version Numbers (aka semver)

Until `go-ipfs` 0.4.X, `go-ipfs` was not using semver to communicate the type of release

Post `go-ipfs` 0.5.X, `go-ipfs` will use semver. This means that patch releases will not contain any breaking changes nor new features. Minor releases might contain breaking changes and always contain some new feature

Post `go-ipfs` 1.X.X (future), `go-ipfs` will use semver. This means that only major releases will contain breaking changes, minors will be reserved for new features and patches for bug fixes.

We do not yet retroactively apply fixes to older releases (no Long Term Support releases for now), which means that we always recommend users to update to the latest, whenever possible.
